      <p>As a person who has experience working on large project and internship before, I would love to tackle new challenges with a new culture and a different mindset that would improve my coding skills. From this internship, I would want to learn more about the company's stack as well as how the technical team divides their work among members. Furthermore, this would be a good chance for me to build up my skill working on different areas of Software Development process including working on API or develop Unit Tests for the program</p>
      <p>As a software engineer, I love to build solution for the problems that I believe would be better to have a software done the task for us. As a child, I learned to make software for every problem in my math class that I found it interesting to become a software engineer in my future. As I entered college, joining cs clubs and listening to leaders in tech through cs workshops helped me learn more about the big impact software could have on our lives and made me think about what I could do as a software engineer. With experience I mentioned in my resume, I want to work more on web component since it is more accessible for many people to use. </p>
